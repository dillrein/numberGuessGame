# Number Guess Game

Objective:
  Use the various beer cans to add up to the random number displayed. 
  Gain a point for each time you match the random number.
  Lose when you go over the random number.
  
Instructions:
  Each round starts off with a randomly generated number(RNG) . Each beer can is given a number value, not displayed to the player. The player must use the different cans to add up to the RNG. If both the players number and the RNG number are equal the player gains a point. Then the RNG number changes, as well as the value of each beer can. If the players number goes over the RNG number, the player loses the round and the game restarts.
  


Notes:
  My objective for this simple game wasn't the UI/ UX for the player, but more the programming of the game and planning for the various outcomes. I wanted to created a smoothly functioning simple game. A way to stretch my mind from my norm.
  
  * Working on displaying the scores at the end of the round, rather than the start of the next round.
  * Trying to make it sure the beer can numbers can always add up the the RNG number. 
  * improve UI/UX
